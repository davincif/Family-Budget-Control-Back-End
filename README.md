# Family Budget Control Requirements

This project is an attempt of joining the Atomic Design and the Ports and Adapters Archteture (AKA Hexagonal Archteture) together, in order to make a software where the core logic is more independent of any specific front-end technology, as well and maintaining it easy for the web designers (who usually makes amazing html and styling codes) away from all the ugly logic needed to make a website work under the hood.
